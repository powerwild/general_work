# Python Coding Assessment

Congratulations on learning the basics of Python! Now, here's a practice
assessment for you to help you study for next week's assessment.

In this assessment, you will write Python code to make a series of unit tests
pass.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository from
   [https://github.com/appacademy/assessment-for-week-17-version-a-python-unit-test-problems].
2. Change directory into the repository.
3. Make sure you are running a version of Python 3.8.
4. Run `python -m unittest` to make sure the tests run.

## Usage

1. **Manually test by typing `python problem_01_while_map.py`**. Before you run
   all the unit tests, use manual testing to compare your result with the
   expected result commented next to the print statements.
2. **Run the tests by typing `python -m unittest`**.
3. Your objective is to implement the code in each of the following Python
   modules so that when you run `python -m unittest`, all tests pass.
   * **problem_01_while_map.py** will have you make tests pass with  a `while`
     loop
   * **problem_02_for_map.py** will have you make tests pass with a `for`
     loop
   * **problem_03_list_comprehension.py** will have you make tests pass with a
     list comprehension
   * **problem_04_if_statement.py** will have you make tests pass with an `if`
     statement
   * **problem_05_class.py** will have you write a class to make tests pass
   * **problem_06_inheritance.py** will have you write classes that inherit from
     one another to make tests pass
   * **problem_07_dictionary.py** will have you use a dictionary to make tests
     pass
   * **problem_08_builtins.py** will have you use one of the built-in functions
     covered in homework to make tests pass
   * **problem_09_getters_and_setters.py** will have you use getter and setter
     properties to make tests pass
   * **problem_10_functions.py** will have you use lexical closures and
     functions that return functions to make tests pass.

## Submitting your project

1. There are two `__pycache__` directories, one in the root of your project and
   one in the `test` subdirectory. Delete both of those `__pycache__`
   directories.
2. ZIP your project directory.
3. Submit it using the button below.
